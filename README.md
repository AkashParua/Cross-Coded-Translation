# Cross-Coded-Translation
## Introduction 
The problem statement given was a cross-coding translation task.
## What is cross-coding translation / text generation ?
### Cross coding translation that contain more than one script / language example...
Statement: I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset
Output required: ‡§Æ‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´ ‡•©‡•¶ **minute** ‡§ï‡§æ **demo** ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§®‡§Ø‡•á **headset** ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á
‡§≤‡§ø‡§è
### Complete cross-coding
There is another kind of cross coding -
Statement: I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset
Output: Mujhe sirf 30 minut ka demo mila tha us naye headset ka istemal karne ke liye
(The script is written in eenglish alphabets while keeping the pronunciation same)
## IDEA !! üí°üí° üß†
Notice in complete cross-coding 
Statement: I had about a 30 <ins>minute</ins> <ins>demo</ins> just using this new <ins>headset</ins>
Output: Mujhe sirf 30 <ins>minute</ins> ka <ins>demo</ins> mila tha us naye <ins>headset</ins> ka istemal karne ke liye
### In both statement and output the spellings are same
We take help of 2 different translation models to acheive this
Markup :    - A pure translation model that translates from english to pure hindi
            - A cross-coding text generation model
Using the first model we find all the words that have same spelling in eglish as well as cross-coded hindi
Then we create a dictionary of hindi words and their corresponding cross coded hindi eg.
```python
knowledge_base['‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü'] = 'minute' # knowledge base 
knowledge_base['‡§π‡•á‡§°‡§∏‡•á‡§ü'] = 'headset'
```
Our goal is to  populate this knowledge_base as much as possible by using the above approach.
Once done use the second model to transalate and replace the words
### We will use synthetic data generated by chatgpt to populate the knowledge base
