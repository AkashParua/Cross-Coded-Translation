# Cross-Coded-Translation
## Introduction 
The problem statement given was a cross-coding translation task.
## What is cross-coding translation / text generation ?
### Cross coding translation that contain more than one script / language example...
Statement: I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset<br>
Output required: ‡§Æ‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´ ‡•©‡•¶ **minute** ‡§ï‡§æ **demo** ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§®‡§Ø‡•á **headset** ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á<br>
‡§≤‡§ø‡§è
### Complete cross-coding
There is another kind of cross coding -
Statement: I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset<br>
Output: Mujhe sirf 30 minut ka demo mila tha us naye headset ka istemal karne ke liye<be>
(The script is written in eenglish alphabets while keeping the pronunciation same)
## IDEA !! üí°üí° üß†
Notice in complete cross-coding 
Statement: I had about a 30 <ins>minute</ins> <ins>demo</ins> just using this new <ins>headset</ins> <br>
Output: Mujhe sirf 30 <ins>minute</ins> ka <ins>demo</ins> mila tha us naye <ins>headset</ins> ka istemal karne ke liye <br>
### In both statement and output the spellings are same
We take help of 2 different translation models to acheive this
- A pure translation model that translates from english to pure hindi
- A cross-coding text generation model<br>
Using the first model we find all the words that have same spelling in eglish as well as cross-coded hindi<br>
Then we create a dictionary of hindi words and their corresponding cross coded hindi eg.
```python
knowledge_base['‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü'] = 'minute' # knowledge base 
knowledge_base['‡§π‡•á‡§°‡§∏‡•á‡§ü'] = 'headset'
```
At first we have to run both the models simultaneously.
Our goal is to  populate this knowledge_base as much as possible by using the above approach.
Once done use the second model to transalate and then replace the words that have english counterpart.
### We will use synthetic data generated by chatgpt to populate the knowledge base
## Usage
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AkashParua/Cross-Coded-Translation.git
```
###  To train locally -
Use `train_full_crosscoded.ipynb` to train the algorithm for fully cross-coding translation model (tokenizer and translator)
### Alternatively 
Download [transalator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekwzOLTV20sg2o_VLaCUBZAzxCuUzo-u/view?usp=sharing)<br>
Download [tokenizer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dpJNWn2nRMpTa2M5cqTWiCdLF3hnpyvc/view?usp=sharing)<br>
Extract the files<br>
Make sure the file structure is -<br>

### Now we are ready to populate the knowledge_base !!üöÄ
### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately due to hardware constrain the model is not very accurate (trained for only 3 epochs) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è 
### Hence we used spaCy , NLP model to remove false positives (words that should remain in hindi but are being translated to english)
We do so by removing the "Verbs" that are mistakently suggested to be english words
